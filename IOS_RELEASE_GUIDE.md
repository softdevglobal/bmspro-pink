   - Xcode will automatically:
     - Create/update certificates
     - Create provisioning profiles
     - Handle code signing

6. **Verify Bundle Identifier**:

   - If not, update it manually

### Step 4: Prepare App Store Assets

Before building, prepare these assets:

#### Required Screenshots (in PNG or JPEG format):
- **iPhone 6.7" Display** (iPhone 14 Pro Max, 15 Pro Max, etc.)
  - Required sizes: 1290 x 2796 pixels (portrait)
- **iPhone 6.5" Display** (iPhone 11 Pro Max, XS Max, etc.)
  - Required sizes: 1242 x 2688 pixels (portrait)
- **iPad Pro 12.9"** (3rd generation and later)
  - Required sizes: 2048 x 2732 pixels (portrait)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Code Signing Issues

If you encounter code signing errors:
1. In Xcode: Runner → Signing & Capabilities
2. Uncheck "Automatically manage signing"
3. Re-check "Automatically manage signing"
4. Select your team again
5. Clean build folder and try again

### Bundle ID Mismatch

If you get bundle ID errors:
- Verify bundle ID in Xcode matches: `com.softdev.bmspro_pink`
- Ensure it's registered in Apple Developer Portal
- Check App Store Connect app uses the same bundle ID

### Version Number Issues

To update version:
1. Edit `pubspec.yaml`: `version: 1.0.0+2` (increment build number)
2. Run: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. Rebuild in Xcode

## 📝 Important Notes
